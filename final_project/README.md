# Applied machine Learning with Python
  Group #7


## To learn how to take two different models that were made in python and attach them to webpages. To figure out how to attach them with using Flask with python. The problem was learning how to take the datasets we found and to push them on a webpage through Flask. It a bit trick using Flask to get user input on one webpage and passing it to another page.

We Tested several models for the Classification and Regression model to see which one would work best with our dataset to give us good accurate prediciton. For the Classification model with the dataset the RandomForest worked best. While the Regression model with the dataset worked best with Serializing.

## Installtion

We used VS Code for this project. With Python code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the model section. Flask with Python to set up the webpages with HTML templates to write the code for the pages.
